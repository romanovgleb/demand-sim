specific business cases:
- courier delivery
- taxi simulation
- take-away point demand simulation

what for:
- answer business (city planning)-related questions
- understand how people (customers) behave
- simulate behaviour in given conditions /scenarios
- test different problem solving algorithms

how:
- per-tick (or per-event)


entities:
- demand (customer): order that pops up
- supply (courier/store/driver/etc.)

optional:
- dispatch option
- surge option
- delivery mode option
- delivery zone
- batch algorithm


functions (what can it do):
- back-test on real data
- different solutions back-to-back comparison
- run & see all operations & parameters step-by-step (aka debugger)
- 


applications:
- taxi
- delivery service
- (dark)store delivery
- traffic modelling?
